# Binary-Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to find the position of a target element in a sorted array. The time complexity is  𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑛 ) O(logn).
How It Works:
Divide and Conquer:

The array is repeatedly divided into two halves.
Compare the target with the middle element.
Narrow down the search space to either the left or right half.
Edge Cases:

If the array is empty, return -1.
If the target is smaller or larger than all elements, return -1.
